=============

The project `atlas-direction-vectors` offers tools to build brain region atlases.
In BBP terminology, an atlas is a bundle of files, mostly volumetric nrrd_ files, which allows
to navigate brain regions and to `place cells`_. Atlases are consumed by the `circuit building`_ pipeline.

Tools are made available through a :ref:`cli`.
